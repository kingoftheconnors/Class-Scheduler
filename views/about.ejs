                    Moc Meetup is the passion project of a UTC Alumni, Connor McPherson, club president
                    of CompUTC. As a programmer with a calling for tinkering and small conveniences,
                    he dreamed of creating a search engine for tracking calendar times in an accessible,
                    visual heatmap. Halfway through his Junior year, he spent half a long weekend tinkering
                    with the UTC course catalog looking for a way to extract the class data in a way he
                    could visualize, with no success.
                </p>

                    In 2019, Connor meet a web programmer and visionary, Kishan Patel, who was experienced
                    with web-scrapers. When Connor explained his vision to him, Kishan proposed a daily-run
                    scraper that captured data from the UTC course catalog into a personal database
                    to give full control of the class format. Connor and Kishan starting meeting at the
                    CompUTC hack nights, and began hacking together a first draft of this project. 
                    At the second half of his senior year, Connor invited another student, Audrey Tan, onto
                    the team to consult on the web app's look and body. Finally, in the Summer of 2021,
                    a full year after Connor graduated, Moc Meetup was released to the UTC student body.

                    The goal of Moc Meetup is to solve help students trying to organize events,
                    and is inspired by the many tools and workaround we used as students to
                    reach out to as many people as possible. Any event organizer knows that
                    finding a time and a room is vital to helping potential members come. This
                    web app is a gift for tutors, event organizers, and leaders at UTC, and I
                    hope this gift helps you in whatever you're trying to do!

                    While this project isn't continuing, the data is actually available to
                    anyone to make visualizations for! This site doubles as a web data connector,
                    so you can connect to the data source we're using and sort through the UTC
                    course data on your own! See the <a href="help#tableau">tableau tutorial</a>
                    section to learn how!

                    Furthermore, if you want to use the source code of this project for your own
                    endeavors, we are in full support of that! You can find the source-code on

                    me if you do something illegal on accident. You can also try interfacing
